2025 Game Off Attempt - First Game Ever

A very rushed and unlikely to be complete in time game about speeding through a real-physics based ocean to the music you love, while the waves try to topple you.

Unless some kind soul takes it upon themselves to offer help in the next two weeks, all design assets, art, coding, and sound design (though it will be limited as I intend to have the ability to use MP3 audio support), will be entirely done by me.

Editor/Developer's Note: I've never done anything like this in full scale before, I have some AutoHotkey/JavaScript experience, 8 months of trial-by-fire graphic design, digital art, and model-design practice supporting growing digital creators, and roughly 2 hours playing around with Godot. If you're reading this because I managed to submit in time, miracles do happen.
